# Feature-Request-Checklist
    
**Please make sure the feature you are requesting has not already been reported!**

- [ ] I have added the __feature request__ label to this issue
- [ ] **Optional**: I have a specific Design in mind
- [ ] **Optional**: This feature is seeking to fix an existing problem
    
If your checklist is **not** fully ticked, please try to complete it such that it does. Optional parts are not required. You can freely delete those. Either remove the _Optional-tags_ or remove the whole _Optional-part._
    
The following is a template to help you state the request clearly.
