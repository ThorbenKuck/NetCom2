/**
 * A ReceivePipeline differs from the {@link com.github.thorbenkuck.keller.pipe.Pipeline} by the Class
 * which they hold.
 * <p>
 * It holds the OnReceive-Family instead of the {@link Consumer}. With method-overloading, you may provide any of the
 * OnReceive-interfaces, without changing the code massively. This is, if you write it as an Lambda or a Method reference.
 * <p>
 * So, for example, if you have the following code:
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 *     {@code
 * public void register(CommunicationRegistration registration) {
 * registration.register(TestObject.class)
 *        .addFirst(this::handle);
 * }
 *
 * private void handle(TestObject testObject) {
 *     // do something with the test Object
 *     ...
 * }
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * You can change it easily by simply changing the handle method like this:
 * <p>
 * <pre><code>
 * private void handle(Session session, TestObject testObject) {
 *     // do something with the test Object AND the Session
 *     ...
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 * <p>
 * or, if you need the Connection:
 * <p>
 * <pre><code>
 * private void handle(Connection connection, Session session, TestObject testObject) {
 *     // do something with the test Object, the Session AND the Connection
 *     ...
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 * <p>
 * You do not need to change the register Method with this. The only important thing is, that the sequence of those 3 Objects
 * is not changed. So first the Connection, then the Session, then the Object. You may leave out any Number of parameters,
 * starting at the left side.
 * <p>
 * The massive amount of Methods is simply for convenience sake.
 *
 * @param <T> T tye Type that should be handled by this ReceivePipeline
